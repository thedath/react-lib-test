# React Lib Starter

This project provides a boilerplate to help you create and publish reusable React components to npm. It is built with following tools to ensure an efficient development experience.

## Features

- **Vite**: Fast development and optimized bundling for your component library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **pnpm**: Efficient package management with improved performance and disk space usage.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for better code quality and maintainability.
- **Commitizen**: Standardized commit messages for better collaboration.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated Continuous Integration and Deployment.
- **Release Please**: Automated semantic versioning and release management through Pull Requests.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 16.0.0)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (>= 8.0.0)

### Note: The consumer of your npm package will need to have TailwindCSS installed in their project.

## Getting Started

To start using this boilerplate and manually release, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ByteMeBaby/react-lib-starter.git 
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pnpm:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

To manually release a new version of your component library, follow these steps:

4. Build the library for production:

   ```
   pnpm build
   ```

5. Publish the library to npm:
   ```
    pnpm publish
   ```

## Auto Releasing with Release Please

This project uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for semantic release. To release a new version of your component library, follow these steps:

### Setting up environment

1. Rename folder `github` to `.github`.
2. Create a new GitHub token as `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the `repo` scope.
3. In repository settings -> Actions -> General -> workflow permissions, Allow github actions to create and approve pull requests.
4. Create a new NPM token as `NPM_TOKEN` and put it under your repository secrets.
5. You can change the release workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml` file.

### How to semantically release

This is a commitizen friendly project. So, you can use `pnpm commit` to commit your changes. It will automatically generate a commit message for you. When you merge your changes into the main branch, Release Please will automatically create a release PR for you, based on the commit messages.

1. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
2. Make your changes and commit them using Commitizen: `pnpm commit`.
3. Push your changes to your fork and create a Pull Request.
4. The Release Please GitHub Action will automatically create a release PR when new changes are merged into the main branch.
5. Review the release PR and merge it to create a new release.

## Contributing

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`.
3. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
4. To ensure all the githooks are instakked run `pnpm husky install`. This should enable Commitizen for `git commit`.
5. Push your changes to your branch and create a Pull Request to `main` branch.
